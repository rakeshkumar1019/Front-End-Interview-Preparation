# `let` vs `var` vs `const` in JavaScript

## What's the difference between `var`, `let`, and `const`?

-  `var` is function-scoped and allows re-declaration, but it's error-prone due to hoisting.  
- `let` is block-scoped and supports reassignment, making it useful for loops and dynamic values.  
-  `const` is also block-scoped but prevents reassignment, ideal for constants.  
> **In modern JavaScript, prefer `const` by default and use `let` when necessary.**

## ‚úÖ Key Differences

| Feature              | `var`             | `let`             | `const`           |
|----------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Scope**            | Function-scoped   | Block-scoped      | Block-scoped      |
| **Re-declaration**   | ‚úÖ Allowed         | ‚ùå Not allowed     | ‚ùå Not allowed     |
| **Re-assignment**    | ‚úÖ Allowed         | ‚úÖ Allowed         | ‚ùå Not allowed     |
| **Hoisting**         | ‚úÖ Yes *(initialized to `undefined`)* | ‚úÖ Yes *(not initialized)* | ‚úÖ Yes *(not initialized)* |
| **Temporal Dead Zone** | ‚ùå No             | ‚úÖ Yes             | ‚úÖ Yes             |

## üîç Scope Example

```js
function example() {
  if (true) {
    var a = 10;
    let b = 20;
    const c = 30;
  }

  console.log(a); // ‚úÖ 10
  console.log(b); // ‚ùå ReferenceError
  console.log(c); // ‚ùå ReferenceError
}
example();
```
- var is function-scoped, so a is accessible outside the block.
- let and const are block-scoped, so b and c are not accessible outside the block.
  
## Re-declaration & Re-assignment
```javascript
var x = 1;
var x = 2; // ‚úÖ Allowed

let y = 1;
// let y = 2; // ‚ùå SyntaxError

const z = 1;
// z = 2;      // ‚ùå TypeError
```
- var can be re-declared and reassigned.
- let can be reassigned but not re-declared.
- const can be neither reassigned nor re-declared.
##  Hoisting Behavior
```javascript
console.log(a); // undefined
var a = 5;

console.log(b); // ‚ùå ReferenceError
let b = 5;

console.log(c); // ‚ùå ReferenceError
const c = 5;
```
- var is hoisted and initialized as undefined.
- let and const are hoisted but not initialized, and live in a Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) until declared.

## Execution Context & Hoisting Explained
When JavaScript executes code, it creates an Execution Context. This has two phases:

1. Memory Creation Phase
The engine scans the code and allocates memory for variables and functions.

2. Code Execution Phase
Variables are assigned values and functions are invoked.

## What Happens During Hoisting?
| Keyword | Memory Creation Phase                         | Code Execution Phase              |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `var`   | Hoisted & initialized with `undefined`        | Value is assigned when reached    |
| `let`   | Hoisted but **not initialized** (TDZ applies) | Error if accessed before declared |
| `const` | Hoisted but **not initialized** (TDZ applies) | Must be initialized immediately   |

## How JavaScript sees it internally:
```javascript
// Memory Creation Phase
var x = undefined;
let y; // TDZ starts
const z; // TDZ starts

// Execution Phase
console.log(x); // undefined
x = 10;

console.log(y); // Error: TDZ
y = 20;

console.log(z); // Error: TDZ
z = 30; // const must also be initialized here

```


## Best Practices
| Use This | When                                                                  |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `var`    | ‚ö†Ô∏è Avoid. Use only in legacy code.                                    |
| `let`    | When the variable's value needs to change (e.g., in loops, counters). |
| `const`  | ‚úÖ Default choice for all variables unless reassignment is needed.     |
